## Chapter 1. Introduction
> Architecture is about the important stuffâ€¦whatever that is.

> -- <cite>Ralph Johnson</cite>

* You can not describe a system solely by it's structure, knowledge of the architecture characteristics, architecture decisions, and design principles is also needed to fully understand the architecture of the system.
  - The *architecture characteristics* define the success criteria of a system
  - Architecture decisions define the rules for how a system should be constructed ( variance and variance models )
  - A design principle differs from an architecture decision in that a design principle is a guideline rather than a hard-and-fast rule.

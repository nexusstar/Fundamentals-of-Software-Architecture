## Chapter 1. Introduction
> Architecture is about the important stuff…whatever that is.

> -- <cite>Ralph Johnson</cite>

* You can not describe a system solely by it's structure, knowledge of the architecture characteristics, architecture decisions, and design principles is also needed to fully understand the architecture of the system.
  - The *architecture characteristics* define the success criteria of a system
  - Architecture decisions define the rules for how a system should be constructed ( variance and variance models )
  - A design principle differs from an architecture decision in that a design principle is a guideline rather than a hard-and-fast rule.
### Expectations from SA

* Make Architecture Decisions
    
    *Guide* should guide rather than specify technology choices

* Continually Analyze the Architecture
* Keep Current with Latest Trends
* Ensure Compliance with Decisions
* Diverse Exposure and Experience
* Have Business Domain Knowledge
* Possess Interpersonal Skills

  be able to solve not only technical problems
  
 * Understand and Navigate Politics

> …because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don’t know we don’t know.

### Laws of Software Architecture

* Everything is a tradeoff
* Why is more important than how.
